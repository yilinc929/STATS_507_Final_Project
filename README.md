# Project Readme

## Overview

This project involves an analysis of a large dataset consisting of 25,001 labeled images of cats and dogs, split evenly between the two categories. 
The goal of the project is to compare various machine learning models for image classification and assess their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset is quite large. For those reproducing the analysis, it is important to note that in the data preprocessing section of the Jupyter Notebook, the dataset is imported directly from a local directory.
However, an alternative method for accessing the dataset via Dropbox is also provided in the notebook.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.8)

Jupyter Notebook
